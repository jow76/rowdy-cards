            <h3>Notice:</h3>
            <p>This is very much a work in progress and is very incomplete, ugly and probably buggy. I haven't coded in almost a year and was never that good in the first place, so bare with while I sort this out and don't expect it to ever be completed.</p>
            <p>Right now you're only really supposed to play with 2 players. I'm tryna work out a way to work in a King-of-the-Hill system to player order, but for now it's quite scuffed with any more than 2 players and even then, player 1 always goes first. One workaround while I fix this is to just add 2 players - "A" and "B" - and decide yourself who's who.</p>
            <p>Also, make sure you have pop-ups enabled. Most of this game's feedback is through alerts right now. I know that sucks but I'm pretty confident I can do it properly with a bit more time. Anyway, hope you have fun and remember to stay Rowdy :)</p>
            <p>I'll write the rules out better later, but for now these are the general rules:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>- Initial roll happens automatically. 2 D6 are rolled and the target is this multiplied by 3</li>
                <li>- Player 1 goes first (revolutionary) and rolls 2D6 as many times as they want until they stand, bust or hit the target (Dicejack)</li>
                <li>- If player 1 doesn't bust or hit dicejack, player 2 can roll 2 D6 as much as they want to try and beat P1s score, again until they stand, bust or get dicejack</li>
                <li>- If P1 stands then P2 beats them, P1 drinks the difference between both scores</li>
                <li>- If P1 stands, P2 can choose to stand below P1s score and drink the difference</li>
                <li>- If any player busts, they drink the amount they were over the tagret by</li>
                <li>- If any player gets dicejack, the other player drinks the initial roll (target divided by 3)</li>
                <li>- If both players draw, they both drink the difference between their scores and the target.</li>
            </ul>
