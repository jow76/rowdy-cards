            <h3>About Rowdy Cards</h3>
            <p>We Rowdy Boys love us a good drinking game to start the night. During lockdown, we continued the party online, but found there weren't many drinking games available that didn't require in-person involvement.</p>
            <p>Eventually, we found one. It wasn't Rowdy Cards. The premise was very similar, though. Players would draw cards telling them if and how much they should drink. However, there were 3 main problems with this game:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>1. There weren't many cards and some of them sucked</li>
                <li>2. There was too much kissing and stripping involved for a boys night</li>
                <li>3. It just wasn't Rowdy enough</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The only solution was to make our own cards. Within the first night, 111 cards were created, and since then, that number has grown over double. For years to follow, the Rowdy Boys spent many a night on Tabletop Simulator drawing cards, rolling dice, making the best out of our quarantined situation.</p>
            <p>When lockdown was lifted, terror struck the Boys - we could not play the drinking game on the go! We didn't really care, but since I had to make a project for this web development course I'm on, I decided I might as well start what should have begun a long time ago.</p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I'm Jow - the founder of Rowdy Boys. It's more of a way of life than a physical group of people, therefore anyone can be Rowdy :)</p>
            <p>I love to create stuff, as long as I can use a computer to do so. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/jowsus">Youtube channel</a> where I make gaming videos and the occasional vlog with the boys. I also make music under two names:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>- Sadoma, an instrumental dark ambient trap project</li>
                <li>- Jow Rowdy, an initially-ironic-turned-lowkey-genuine rap project</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Links to my music on various platforms can be found on my <a href="https://www.linktr.ee/jowrowdy">Linktree</a>.</p>
            <p>As I briefly mentioned above, I am currently enrolled in the <a href="https://techeducators.co.uk/">Tech Educators</a> coding Bootcamp, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I hope to start a career in web development or anything similar, since making this site has turned out to be quite enjoyable. You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/jow76">Github profile</a> to see how I'm getting on. I'd even like to revisit this site once I've learned more.</p>
